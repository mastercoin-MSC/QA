# Purchase Mastercoins with Bitcoins (accept currency trade offer)

Transaction Type 22: [Purchase Mastercoins with Bitcoins (accept currency trade offer)](https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/spec#purchase-mastercoins-with-bitcoins)

Each application under test (AUT) must pass the applicable tests listed in [Major Items & Scenarios To Be Tested](https://github.com/marv-engine/QA/blob/master/MastercoinDistributedExchangeTestPlan.md#major-items--scenarios-to-be-tested).

The tests for Purchase Mastercoins with Bitcoins include:

1. user is able to enter valid values for all appropriate fields:
    * Currency identifier (1 for MSC, 2 for Test MSC)
    * Amount to be purchased
    * Address of Sell Offer
1. valid input data is parsed and interpreted correctly, including all valid MSC Protocol transaction types in the blockchain that are supported by the AUT
1. erroneous input data, including a corrupted blockchain, is detected as not valid and handled correctly
1. correct Sell Mastercoins for Bitcoins transactions are generated from valid test input data
1. runtime error conditions are detected and handled correctly (e.g. insufficient funds, application/network/OS failure)
1. all edge cases are handled correctly
1. correct, meaningful messages reflecting transaction success/status or failure are presented to the user

For each test sequence, start in a known state and return to a known state after the test is complete. Run the tests separately and also simultaneously. The simultaneous tests should be run by the same users/addresses in the same roles where possible, and also by different users/addresses.

Where appropriate, tests should be run using the end-user UI and using the API directly.
